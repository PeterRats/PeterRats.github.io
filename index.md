## Research

Research Fields: Indersection of AI and Cyber Security

This includes two directions:
- Using AI techs to solve traditional security problems in a new way
  - AI analysis on Darknet traffic to achieve website fingerprinting
    - Modifying the obfs4 pluggable transport to camouflage the packet flow and escape from the above detection
  - Utilizing CNN, RNN or LSTM to analyse the abnormal traffic of mobile phones
    - THis methodology is also available to detect whether the host is using a proxy.
- The security of AI architecture
  - Adversarial Machine Learning
    - Generating adversarial examples and implementing defence mechanisms on machine learning models
    - Raising up a framework for evaluating the existing defence mechanisms
  - Federated Learning
    - Security issues on Federated Learning systems

8 years of studying and researching has built me priceless ability on fast learning, reading, and doing researches on a specific topics. Also, it feels really great to know some many great researchers, whether they are in Hong Kong, Guang Dong, Beijing or the UK, whether they are PhD students, postdocs, new faculties or respected senior professors. 

## Model United Nations and My Startup

Model United Nations is a welcomed student excurricular activity in Chinese Mainland. I am the founder of the largest nation-wide independent non-profit MUN conference and has been in this activity for 11 years. This eleven-year experience has taught me many things and form my ability of establishing and running a teanm. 

Although MUN seems irrelevant to my major research in Cyber Security， I still find it very worthy ror spending some time on it. It is a great chance to meet and communicate with the young interesting excellent students across the country. Making friends with them, exchanging ideas and opinion, as well as learning from each other, are very precious opportunitry for my personal development. I enjoyed making friends a lot.

### My startup

My startup is an agency to facilitate students studying abroad. Having a small but very effecient team, we help the undergraduate students in many dimensions to apply for their ideal postgraduate abroad study universities. 

**The experience in MUN and my startup has given me much understanding on evaluating a startup by its members. Furthermore, I got to learn some ABCs about company running, shares and finance.**


## Alumini of RDFZhk (The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China -- HK alumni association 人大附中香港校友会) 
Being the secretary gerenal of the HK alumni association, it is a proud for me to know so many brilliant alumni, whose ages differ from thirties or fourties(some even brought their children when we organized some gathering activities) to new freshmen who just graduated from RDFZ and came to HK for undergraduate study. The senior alumins are really helpful, and communicating with them has broadened my vision a lot and taught me some great lessons on life and work.

## Venture Capital Analyst

Currently, I am curious to become an analyst on VC or Angel Investments. Being an euthusiast on cutting-edge techs, I am always thrilled by researching the startups that has great potential developments. Although I have not had any hands-on experience on angel investments, I sincerely feel that this is a job that would bring me great sense of accomplishment and I will never get exhausted on it.

Investments in early rounds (Seed, pre-A round) would be very different from the late round PE investment or dealings on stock markets. For early rounds, the startups are not having a mature commercial patterns. Usually what they have is a initial team of personnel, an idea or a prototype of their products. Thus for the investors, it is crucial to evaluate the company by its initial members team and the idea they raised up. It is like climbing the mountains in the night time, reaching the peak and catching the first shine of light in the dawn. That is the magic that attracted me to this field.  

Thank you for reading my self-introduction. I am always willing to make new friends with great people. Feel free to reach me by the contacts in my README.md file.

## Miscellaneous things（or in my word, fun facts） about me

- I am an amateur \#cyclist in Beijing.
- I read a lot on \#36kr, which is one of my mostly liked apps about news on startups and investments.
- I, other than standard Mandarin and English, speak a little bit Cantonese but not so fluently, and my North China accents affects me a lot when speaking Cantonese. 
- I like cooking a lot.
- I have a nickname of "Rats"(鼠\耗子) along with me since a very young age. So a lot of delegates and organizing team members in my MUN keep calling me by "Rats" instead of my real name. Using this nickname for so long time, I even made it my alternative English surname. Sometimes I use the name “Peter.Rats” in informal occasions.
